#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The only concepts I was still having issues with prior to the GPS was differentiating Git fetch and merge from git pull, and how to resolve a merge conflict. 

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The difference between an untracked change and staging a change to be committed, my partner had a little confusion about this but I needed a refresh as well, which the guide cleared up. Also the difference between a Git fetch and merge opposed to a git pull. Also, the steps of how to handle a merge conflict.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I was still a bit confused on what exactly a git fetch and merge were in comparison to a git pull, so both my guide and my pair helped me clarify this. I also wasn't sure if I was supposed to create a new branch before or after I created a new file, it is before!

####What still confuses you about git?
Nothing really confuses me, as much as I just need as much practice and exposure to it as possible since it is still a newer concept to me. I know we've been working on it for a couple weeks now and feel good about it, but I don't feel as confident as I know I could with the workflow.

#####How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I was really nervous about the first GPS and I had absolutely no reason to be, I really enjoyed it. My guide was super nice and friendly, she made me feel very comfortable and safe to ask any questions I may have had. It was nice to have someone there when both my partner and I were stuck or needed more of an explanation as to why we were doing a certain task. Even when I wasn't stuck or confused, I really liked having someone there just to discuss and have a conversation with about what we were doing and why. We compared and contrasted our own processes and why we each do it that particular way and learned from each other.
