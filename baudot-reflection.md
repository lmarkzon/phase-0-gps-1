#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't struggling with any concepts per se, however there were some commands that needed clarification.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Our guide brought up the difference between staging changes and tracking changes.  Here is my understanding of it now:

Staging: You have your file and either mades changes or created it.  You add the file, staging it for commit.  Then you create your commit and push.

Tracking: You add a file, but don't commit yet.  As you modify it, the local repo is tracking the changes.  When you're ready to commit, you add again and stage for commit.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We discussed the differences between tracking and staging as discussed before, but we also discussed when and how to use fetch, specifically how useful it can be in a collaborative setting.  I'd also asked our guide about origin branches when a repo is created by someone. Essentially, I was trying to figure out the path and how I'd push and pull changes not having the origin on my local repo.

#What still confuses you about git?

As far as I know, I'm pretty caught up to where DBC wants me to be and I am not confused.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I believe it went well.  It's good to pair to get a sense of how we are going to collaborate.  And with the guide there, they can, well, guide us through any holes we find ourselves in.  Most beneficial, it is great to have someone there that can answer any questions as we go along our work.  Sometimes it's difficult to remember what rough patches we went through in our own projects or what general curiosities we have when we're working on something we're new at.  I'm glad we had oversight in order to address those situations throughout the process.
